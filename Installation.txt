LOCATION RECOMMENDATION USING CONTENT-AWARE COLLABORATIVE FILTERING 

Using checkin information along with user and item profile to recommend top k POI's to each user. This model uses
implicit matrix factorisation which factorises the data into user-factor and item factor matrices. Popular location 
recommendation algorithms - Mrec,LightFM,Implicit are compared and perfomance evaluated on multiple factors.

Datasets:
Checkin data [checkin_bj_uniq.txt]
ItemProfile  [poiInfo_jiepang.txt]
UserProfile	 [weiboUserProfile_csv.txt]

User Profile is further extended to include tweets from each user to handle cold start problem. Tweets are obtainted
from social network sites [Weibo] and scrapped and processed using necessary tools.
